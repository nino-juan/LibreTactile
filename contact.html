    <p>
      If you need help building or modifying one of our projects, or if you
      would like to encourage the team or join our efforts, you can get check
      out the FAQ, and join in the discussion, or send an email to
      libretactile@gmail.com. Don't forget to read the code of conduct to
      understand the kind of open and welcoming environment we encourage. If you
      would like to contribute to the project, follow the contributing
      guideliness. We are a small team made-up mostly of academic researchers (I
      am currently the only developer). So any artist, writer, translator,
      tester, accessibility expert, researcher, developer maintainer, or anyone
      who can (and wishes) to help is very much appreciated. You can also show
      support for the project, through a financial contribution by using our
      GitHub sponsor button (pending). If you are a researcher or developer with
      an interesting vision for one of our projects, you can request a beta
      prototype by filling this form (pending). Please consider that we have to
      prioritize requests according to our limited resources.
