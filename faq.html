    <p>What is an open organization? https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition 

        What does libretactile produces?
        Research publications, O.S. tech designs and products {hw/sw devices}, merchandise, implementation guides.
        & connection (platform to connect ) academics, developers, users, and enthusiasts of tactile technology from different fields. 
        What is your R&D approach ?
        Although each project comes with its particularities, our projects are developed by prioritizing the following design considerations:
        Open source, which means anyone in the world can build, support, improve and sell the hardware so it can mature over time.
        Modular, simple and scalable designs that allow for different configurations to build more complex tactile human-computer interfaces.
        Low-cost, to make it easier for everyone to access our tactile gadgets.
        Easy to use for users, hobbyists, makers, technicians, clinicians, and researchers.
        Easy to build with basic software or electronic skills, tools, and components.
        Easy to modify, to facilitate the implementation of new ideas.
        What is our vision?
        Touching the digital.
        What is our mission?
        To connect researchers, developers, users, and enthusiasts of tactile technology from different fields for the equitable research, development, distribution and support of open source tactile technologies for human-computer interaction. 
        What inspires our work?
        “I am, because we are; and since we are therefore I am.” - expression of Ubuntu by J. S. Mbiti
        The idea of interconnection and interdependence leads to a sense of appreciation of and responsibilty towards others.
        "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."- Issac Newton
        The open source principles, which empowers people with the cumulative fruits of the efforts of humanity.
        I'm insipred by how organizations like Makers Making Change allows technically-skilled people to meet the needs of others.
        How to join the effort?
        You could lend a hand in any area of your interest, like writing, translating, testing, improving the design, spreading the word or maintaining the repositories.
        Here is a list of tasks we prioritize, although, as the only developer on the team, I appreciate any help. You can also support the project financially via the Github sponsor button.
        What is open source hardware?
        The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) defines Open Source Hardware (OSHW) as:
        "... hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design."
        If you wish to learn more about open source hardware, it's licensing and certification, check out their FAQ. The resources provided by the OSHWA have been instrumental during the development of this project.
        What about hardware licenses?
        Copyright does not apply to hardware the same way as it does to software, making licensing hardware more complicated. It is not recommended to use a software license (like MIT) for hardware designs. However, the CERN has written an open source hardware license (OHL) that is analogous to open source software licenses and complies with the OSHWA definition of open hardware (and its also applicable to software).
        The CERN OHL v2 has three variants, strong reciprocal S, weak reciprocal W, and permissive P. Our project is licensed under the CERN-OHL-P v2.
        "CERN-OHL-P is a permissive licence. It allows people to take your code, relicense it and use it without any obligation to distribute the sources when they ship a product". - CERN OHL FAQ.
        Why choose a permissive license?
        After all, this project was originally conceived to facilitate the development of assistive technology for visually impaired people, which often face low rates of adoption, slow implementation of new technologies, lack of documentation, support, and training.
        Often the designs of new assistive devices simply never reach the market (and hence the people they try to help).
        What are the implications of the license?
        Here are some of the most important implications of the CERN-OHL-P:
        You can make and distribute the hardware described in the design files (see notices to include in #5).
        You can take the design, relicense it and use it without any obligation to distribute the sources. If you relicense the project, you should include a copy of the license text (see notices to include in #5).
        You can copy, distribute, or modify the design files. When sharing the hardware design source files, the license text, license use guide and the change log (<project_repo>/docs/changes.md) should be included (see notices to include in #5).
        If you make modifications to the design, these should be described in the change log (<project_repo>/docs/changes.md).
        The copyright and trademark notices, references to the CERN-OHL-P v2, and disclaimer of warranties:
        Should be kept intact if you don't make any changes to the design.
        Should be updated as applicable if you make any changes to the design.
        The design files or hardware is provided 'as is' without any warranty. The licensor(s) have no liability for damages related to the project.
        Anyone litigating for patent infringement would lose the rights granted by the license.
        If it comes to our attention that you have infringed the terms of the license, we might notify you. You have a grace period of 30 days after receiving the notification to come into compliance, which is especially helpful if you infringed the license terms inadvertently.
        Disclaimer: Although we try our best to share appropriate information, we cannot provide legal advice. If you notice something wrong or inconsistent, please get in touch.
        More questions?
        If you have more questions or would like to share your feedback please do so in the discussion tab of LibreTactile Github page, so everyone can benefit from the conversation.
